# 351Assignment4
An expansion on assignment 3 that incorporates Antlr

This incorporates Antlr along with python to create players for a game that can be selected via inputs. These players will be put into the
game environment where they will move around in their programmed manner and collide with one another with a 50/50 chance to kill the other dot
players can also collide into trees or "food" to spawn another player. Game continues until only one team of dots remains. 


Example video can be seen here.
